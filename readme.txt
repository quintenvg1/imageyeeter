For windows Download the 64 bit python installer and make sure to also install python3 pip.
To find official installers go to https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe
You should have python3 installed and use pip3 to install cv2 as follows:

pip3 install opencv-contrib-python

then the rest of the scripts are self explanitory

for best results, use 1080p landscape images.
